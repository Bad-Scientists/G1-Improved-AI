## Tetris in Gothic
Activate Marvin mode, open console and insert item `insert BookOfTetris`. Open it and play :wink:
### Controls
 - Left & Right arrow keys - control movement
 - Down arrow key - move tetrominoe down 1 row
 - Spacebar - rotate tetrominoe
 - Enter - confirm position

I've had a ton of fun reimplementing this in Gothic using Ikarus & LeGo script-packets - feel free to use as you wish:smile:
