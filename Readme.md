# G1 Improved AI
Our goal here is to improve G1 AI, we want to fix all bugs, make AI more 'clever' and more immersive.

### Mission statement:

1. port G2A AI scripts (which are overall less complex) to G1.
2. minimize `aivar` usage with bit-masking, many of them are simple `true/false` values.
3. emulate G2A functions that do not exist in G1.
4. some G1 scripts will still have to be used to ensure G1 'feel'.
5. improve AI and make it more immersive!

Once we are done and happy with this project we will publish all scripts right here :)
